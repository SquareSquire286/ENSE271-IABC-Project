# Lo-Fi Prototyping

**Work Period:** 13 January - 5 March 2021

**Overview:** The work that we completed during this phase primarily consisted of high-design ideation and analysis of existing content. We produced several lo-fi prototypes of designs for the header, navigation bar, home page, and content pages, as well as an asset and content inventory of the current IABC site, sitemaps, and an updated user story map.
