**Lo-Fidelity Prototype Timeline**:
- See all lo-fis [here](Design%20Ideation/Lo-Fidelity%20Sketches/AllDesignSketches.pdf) or read about our process in the timeline below!  

Our team went through several lo-fi revisions before landing on our final presentation sketches.  
First, we individually sketched our [home page](Design%20Ideation/Lo-Fidelity%20Sketches/FirstDraftHomePage.pdf) ideas.  
Next, we created some paper [prototypes](Design%20Ideation/Lo-Fidelity%20Sketches/Prototyping.pdf) to explore user interaction.  
After this, the team discussed more details about [page layout](Design%20Ideation/Lo-Fidelity%20Sketches/PageLayout.pdf).  
As a group we decided to focus on mobile designs for the client.   
We then designed three [mobile home](Design%20Ideation/Lo-Fidelity%20Sketches/MobileHome.pdf) page ideas and three [content page](Design%20Ideation/Lo-Fidelity%20Sketches/MobileContent.pdf) ideas.  
In the end, we presented the client with:   
- Three [header](Design%20Ideation/Lo-Fidelity%20Sketches/Headers.pdf) options  
- Variations of [navigation](Design%20Ideation/Lo-Fidelity%20Sketches/PresentedNavigation.pdf)  
- Three [home](Design%20Ideation/Lo-Fidelity%20Sketches/PresentedHomePages.pdf) page designs  
- Three [content](Design%20Ideation/Lo-Fidelity%20Sketches/PresentedContentPages.pdf) page designs
