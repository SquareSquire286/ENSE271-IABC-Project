### Project Background / Business Opportunity
The IABC Regina chapter is an organization skilled in the art of communication. Unfortunately the functionality of the current IABC website does not allow administrators to appropriately communicate information and business updates to members. Redesigning the site to include high level functionality that can be updated with little technical knowledge will increase member engagement while saving administrators time. 

### Northstar / Carryover Customers
*Northstar* customers are IABC site administrators.  
*Carryover* customers are IABC members and site viewers.

### Project Assumptions
- Site design using Wordpress
- Design focus for mobile
- Low tech customers
- 

### Project Constraints
- < $1,000 budget
-
