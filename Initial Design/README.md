# Initial Design

**Work Period:** 25 January - 12 February 2021

**Overview:** The work that we completed during this phase primarily consisted of requirements analysis, high-level design ideation, and discussion with our customers. We produced an affinity diagram, an empathy map, and a user story diagram, which will dictate our process of development for the remainder of the semester.
