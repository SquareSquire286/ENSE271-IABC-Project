<p align="center">The Mandalorians - ENSE 271 Winter 2021</p>

---
Members of the IABC Regina chapter provided feedback to ENSE271 project groups following presentations on high level concepts for the IABC Regina website design project.

### Feedback for the Mandalorians:
- Appreciated how we outlined the entire process of high-level design.
- Administrator roles are not defined and duties are subject to frequent change
     - Website administration tasks should be generalized and not grouped by Volunteer role
- Newsletters and email communication is handled by a different application and maintained separately 
- Opportunity for dialogue / two-way communication on the website is a good idea
- FAQ page - yes
- Site not monitored 24/7 - notification system would be asset
     - They want provide quick responses
     - Approve public comments before they are posted

### Notes from other presentations:
- Avoid creating barriers to users (logins etc)
- Blog Page - two way communication. 
     - Accounts - login with google/facebook
- Want scheduling / expiration of site content
     - Automate as much of these regular actions as possible
- Emphasis on event and payment plug-ins
- Reduce manual work
- Want information all in one place
- Outside members can attend events
- Comment approval before posting



### How does this feedback guide our group:
- Confirmed many of our choices
- Shift focus from analytics to blog
- Add monitoring for blog comments
- Add notification system for site admin tasks(job postings, FAQ, Blog Comments, etc)
- Add scheduling / expiration of site content
