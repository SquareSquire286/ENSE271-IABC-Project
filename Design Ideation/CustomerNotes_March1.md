<p align="center">The Mandalorians - ENSE 271 Winter 2021</p>

---
Members of the IABC Regina chapter provided feedback to ENSE271 project groups following presentations on low fidelity design and function concepts for the IABC Regina website design project.

### Feedback for the Mandalorians:

- Liked full-width, mobile style content pages with vertical scrolling
- Preferred shallow navigation without nested (submenu) options
- Homepage should contain as much content as possible (i.e. social media/blog, About Us info, About IABC membership)
- Liked icon-based navigation 
- Accordian-style content cards is appealing
- IABC choices on our lo-fi presentation: 
    - Header: Jenn liked option A, Trilby liked C
    - Nav: Both liked A
    - Homepage: Option B; however, use of expandable cards is good 
- Appreciated our focus on mobile-first design

### Notes from other presentations:
- "The simpler, the better" was a common theme
- Positive response to idea of New and Current items on homepage
- Liked the idea of content expiring automatically so that they don't have outdated material
- Consolidate navigation and have shallow navigation
- Emphasized many times how a mobile-first approach is desirable; they expect mobile activity to surpass desktop computers
- No large hero/banner images, very shallow if any
    - Use images to draw attention to events or blog
- Homepage is a priority, most of the content should appear here

### How does this feedback guide our group:
- Confirmed many of our design ideas
- Our next sketches will focus on mobile-first design and use full-width cards, vertical scrolling, and button icon based navigation
- We will try to consolidate navigation to fewer pages and include more content on the homepage
