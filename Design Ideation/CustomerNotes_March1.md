---
Members of the IABC Regina chapter provided feedback to ENSE271 project groups following presentations on low fidelity design and function concepts for the IABC Regina website design project.

### Feedback for the Mandalorians:

- Liked full width, mobile style content pages with vertical scrolling
- Preferred shallow navigation without nested(submenu) options
- Homepage should contain as much content as possible: Things like social media/blog, About Us info, About IABC membership
- Liked icon based navigation 
- Accordian style content cards is appealing
- IABC choices on our lo-fi presentation: 
    - Header:Jenn likes option A, Trilby liked C
    - Nav: Both liked A
    - Homepage: Option B, however uses of expandible cards is good 
- Appreciated our focus on mobile first

### Notes from other presentations:
- The simpler, the better was a common theme
- Positive response to idea of New and Current items on homepage
- liked the idea of content expiring automatically so they don't have outdated material
- Consolidate navigation and have shallow navigation
- Emphasised many times how a mobile first approach is desirable, they expect mobile activity to surpass desktop computers
- no large hero/banner images, very shallow if any
    - use images to draw attention to events or blog
- Homepage is a priority, most of the content should appear here

### How does this feedback guide our group:
- confirmed many of our design ideas
- our next design will focus on mobile first design, use full width cards, vertical scrolling, button icon based navigation
- We will try to consolidate navigation to fewer pages and include more content on the homepage
