# Design Ideation

**Work Period:** 13 February - 5 March 2021

**Overview:** The work that we completed during this phase primarily consisted of high-level design ideation and analysis of existing content. We produced numerous lo-fi prototypes of designs for the header, navigation bar, home page, and content pages, as well as sitemaps, an updated user story map, and asset and content inventories of the current IABC Regina website.
